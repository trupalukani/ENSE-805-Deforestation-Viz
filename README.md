## Project Overview

Deforestation is one of the largest contributors to climate change, biodiversity loss, and ecological degradation. However, the challenge lies in accessing and interpreting vast deforestation datasets. Most existing tools require specialized technical expertise, limiting their accessibility to non-experts.

The **Deforestation Data Platform** aims to solve this by offering a **user-friendly**, **real-time**, and **interactive** platform that simplifies the tracking, comparison, and analysis of global deforestation trends, helping drive better, data-informed environmental decisions.

## UN SDGs

- SDG 15: Life on Land - Combat deforestation and protect terrestrial ecosystems.
- SDG 13: Climate Action

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize real-time deforestation trends, forest loss, and regional comparisons.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze deforestation drivers (agriculture, urbanization, logging) and their effects on different regions.
- **Data Integration**: Combines multiple publicly available datasets for a comprehensive overview of global deforestation patterns.
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Tools**: Utilizes Power BI to make complex deforestation data easy to interpret, with customizable reports, dynamic visualizations, and real-time filtering.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for non-experts, empowering policymakers, students, and researchers to make informed decisions based on accurate, up-to-date information.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Python**: For data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Public Datasets**: Utilizes global deforestation data sources from institutions like FAO, Global Forest Watch, and other publicly accessible platforms.

## Goals and Vision

The Deforestation Data Platform aims to:

- Increase the **accessibility** of deforestation data for a larger audience.
- Provide an **easy-to-use** interface for understanding deforestation trends.
- Support **evidence-based** decision-making for environmental organizations, researchers, and policymakers.
- Expand the platformâ€™s reach to regional and global environmental monitoring networks, helping in the fight against deforestation.
